   - All dynamic fields show current values
4. ✅ Change some field values
5. ✅ Click "Update Production Step"
6. ✅ Should redirect back with success message
7. ✅ Verify changes are saved (click "View Data" again)

## 🔍 **Error Testing**

**Step 6: Test Error Scenarios**
1. ✅ Try "View Data" on invalid step ID manually
2. ✅ Try editing step without permissions
3. ✅ Try deleting step without admin role
4. ✅ Submit edit form with invalid data
5. ✅ Test network errors (disable internet briefly)

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Manual Testing**

1. **If any issues found**: Report specific errors
2. **If all tests pass**: CRUD system is production ready!
3. **Consider adding**: Audit trail UI, batch operations, advanced filters

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If any test fails, provide:
- Exact error message
- Steps to reproduce
- Browser console errors (F12)
- Which test step failed

The CRUD system is architecturally sound and backend-tested. 
Frontend testing will verify the complete user experience!
