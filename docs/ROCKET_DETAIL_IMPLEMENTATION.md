## Next Development Steps

With rocket management now complete, the next development priorities are:

1. **Production Steps Tracking** - Link production activities to rockets
2. **Approval Workflow** - Implement step approval process
3. **User Management** - Admin features for user administration
4. **Reporting System** - Data export and progress reports

## Usage Instructions

### For All Users:
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Click "View" on any rocket
3. View comprehensive rocket information
4. Use quick status update as needed

### For Admin/Engineers:
1. Click "Edit Rocket" to modify rocket information
2. Update serial number, project name, or status
3. Save changes and verify updates

### For Admins Only:
1. Use "Delete Rocket" for permanent removal
2. Confirm deletion in modal dialog
3. Verify rocket removal from dashboard

## Performance Considerations

- **Single Query Loads:** Minimal database queries per page
- **Efficient CSS:** Targeted styling without bloat
- **JavaScript Minimal:** Only essential client-side code
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly without performance cost

The rocket detail and edit functionality is now fully operational and provides a comprehensive foundation for the complete rocket management system. All security measures are in place, and the user experience is professional and intuitive.
